In this project, I will create an entire web page from a design provided for me by "The Odin Project".

I intent to use all of the skills I learned, incorporating many kinds of css tricks, flexbox, and even learn some new methods of design learned through independent studies on the internet.

Git add/commit EARLY and OFTEN!!
